  method,
  of_samples = T,
  correlation_threshold = 0.9,
  log_transform = F,

  Dim_b_column
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A `tbl` formatted as | <SAMPLE> | <TRANSCRIPT> | <COUNT> | <...> |}

\item{.element}{The name of the element column (normally samples).}

\item{.feature}{The name of the feature column (normally transcripts/genes)}

\item{.value}{The name of the column including the numerical value the clustering is based on (normally transcript abundance)}

\item{method}{A character string. The cluster algorithm to use, ay the moment k-means is the only algorithm included.}

\item{of_samples}{A boolean. In case the input is a tidysc object, it indicates Whether the element column will be sample or transcript column}

\item{correlation_threshold}{A real number between 0 and 1. For correlation based calculation.}

\item{log_transform}{A boolean, whether the value should be log-transformed (e.g., TRUE for RNA sequencing data)}

\item{Dim_a_column}{A character string. For reduced_dimension based calculation. The column of one principal component}

\item{Dim_b_column}{A character string. For reduced_dimension based calculation. The column of another principal component}
}
\value{
A tbl object with with dropped recundant elements (e.g., samples).
}
\description{
remove_redundancy() takes as imput a `tbl` formatted as | <SAMPLE> | <TRANSCRIPT> | <COUNT> | <...> | for correlation method or | <DIMENSION 1> | <DIMENSION 2> | <...> | for reduced_dimensions method, and returns a `tbl` with dropped elements (e.g., samples).

\details{
\lifecycle{experimental}

This function removes redundant elements from the original data set (e.g., samples or transcripts). For example, if we want to define cell-type specific signatures with low sample redundancy. This function returns a tibble with dropped recundant elements (e.g., samples). Two redundancy estimation approaches are supported: (i) removal of highly correlated clusters of elements (keeping a representative) with method="correlation"; (ii) removal of most proximal element pairs in a reduced dimensional space.
