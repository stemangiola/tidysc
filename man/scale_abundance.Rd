\title{Normalise the counts of transcripts/genes}
\usage{
scale_abundance(.data, verbose = TRUE, action = "add")
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A `tbl` formatted as | <SAMPLE> | <TRANSCRIPT> | <COUNT> | <...> |}

\item{action}{A character string between "add" (default) and "get". "add" joins the new information to the input tbl (default), "get" return a non-redundant tbl with the just new information.}

\item{.sample}{The name of the sample column}

\item{.transcript}{The name of the transcript/gene column}

\item{.abundance}{The name of the transcript/gene abundance column}

\item{cpm_threshold}{A real positive number. It is the threshold of count per million that is used to filter transcripts/genes out from the normalisation procedure. The normalisation inference is then applied back to all unfiltered data.}

\item{prop}{A real positive number between 0 and 1. It is the threshold of proportion of samples for each transcripts/genes that have to be characterised by a cmp bigger than the threshold to be included for normalisation procedure.}

\item{method}{A character string. The methods used by the function. The method is passed to the function `calcNormFactors` from edgeR package.}

\item{reference_selection_function}{A fucntion that is used to selecting the reference sample for normalisation. It could be max (default), which choose the sample with maximum library size; or median, which chooses the sample with median library size.}
}
\value{
A tbl object with additional columns with normalised data as `<NAME OF COUNT COLUMN> normalised`
}
\description{
scale_abundance() takes as imput a `tbl` formatted as | <SAMPLE> | <TRANSCRIPT> | <COUNT> | <...> | and normalises the data for the library size (e.g., with TMM algorithm, Robinson and Oshlack doi.org/10.1186/gb-2010-11-3-r25).

\details{
\lifecycle{experimental}

normalises the data for the library size
(e.g., with TMM algorithm, Robinson and Oshlack doi.org/10.1186/gb-2010-11-3-r25).
Lowly transcribed transcripts/genes (defined with cpm_threshold and prop parameters)
are filtered out from the normalisation procedure.
The normalisation inference is then applied back to all unfiltered data.
