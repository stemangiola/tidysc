\title{Aggregates multiple read counts from the same samples/cells (e.g., from isoforms)
This function aggregates read counts over samples, concatenates other character columns, and averages other numeric columns}

  .sample, .cell, .transcript, .abundance, keep_integer = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{input.df}{A tibble}

\item{aggregation_function}{A function for counts aggregation (e.g., sum)}

\item{.sample}{A character name of the sample column}

\item{.transcript}{A character name of the gene/transcript name column}

\item{.abundance}{A character name of the read count column}
}
\value{
A tibble with aggregated genes and annotation
}
